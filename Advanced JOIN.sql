#One way to make a query run faster is to reduce the number of calculations that need to be performed.
Some of the high-level things that will affect the number of calculations a given query will make include:
1.Table size,2.Joins,3.Aggregations
Query runtime is also dependent on some things that you canâ€™t really control related to the database itself:
Other users running queries concurrently on the database
Database software and optimization (e.g., Postgres is optimized differently than Redshift)

#UNION removes duplicate records (where all columns in the results are the same), UNION ALL does not.
